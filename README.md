Electrical_grid_stability

Introduction

Energy production and consumption must always be in balance.
For electrical grids to be stable, there needs to be a balance between supply and demand for electricity.
Electrical grid’s stability prediction analysis uses linear regression.
Model’s performance are evaluated by calculating various error values. Variation between test and
predicted data is visualized using matplotlib.
